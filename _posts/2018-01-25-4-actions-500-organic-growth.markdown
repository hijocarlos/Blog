I like to consider my articles reminders for my future self.

I mean, the techniques I am going to describe here are simple and have helped me with so many clients, that I must not overlook them. 

So hey, future me, here are few tips (and a backstory) for you - or whoever might be reading this:

Back in October ('17), I started working with a client in the dental industry (yeah, he's a dentist). His service is top-notch, and his specialty is "veneers" (lentes de contato dental, in Brazilian Portuguese). 

Lucky me, he already had a pretty nice list article about seven essential things to know about veneers. 

Cool. The article was reasonably good, but I knew we could do better.

### Back in September, the article's monthly pageviews were only 289.

Not much traffic. 



### Here's SEMRush data:

Ranking #11 for "lentes de contato dental"(9.9k) and #9 for "lente de contato dental" (6.6k).




Also, because of the market's interests, we had a feeling that the volume of searches would grow, but at the time was just a hunch. 

So, I planned some optimizations for that article. My main goals were to improve CTR and Keyword countings. I also wanted to offer a nicer experience to the user, which meant cleaning some clutter and implementing some things. So, I pretty much:

## Extended the content (and enriched it with media)
That's number one priority. One of the first things I did was check the competition so that I could make the copy longer and better. I also enriched the content with LSI keywords and other long tail terms related to veneers. 

Besides that, I changed the image of the post (and optimized it correctly) and also added a case video so that it could be more informative. 

## Optimized for AMP
AMP = Accelerated Mobile Pages. Mobile first is a top priority for Google, and much of the organic traffic was from mobile. So I just did what needed to be done. 

Since I was working with Wordpress, I used a plugin called "[AMP for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/)" ([Automattic](https://automattic.com/), I love you) and "[Glue](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/glue-for-yoast-seo-amp/) for Yoast" to set everything.  

Google loves adaptable content, and so do people (remember that UX is king).

## Added some Schema Markup & Structured Data 
The [structured data](https://moz.com/blog/structured-data-for-seo-2)helped Google bots digest the information on the page and understand what it is about. And I could also add some schema which helped to show some additional info and the ratings from the article on the SERP (aka a [Rich Snippet](https://www.outerboxdesign.com/web-design-articles/Rich-Snippets-Importance-For-An-eCommerce-Website))

For the rating stars to appear on the results I used a plugin called kkRatings. Quite good and it indexed very fast.

## Changed from HTTP to HTTPS (SSL)
Security is very important. For Google and also for the user. The SSL certificate ensures that your traffic is well encrypted and that the user is safe. Basically, it's good because:

- Encryption secures that a user’s activity cannot be tracked and their information stolen
- Integrity of data prevents files from being corrupted 
- Authentication also protects against attacks and builds user trust

And it's also known that Google gives you a little boost for HTTPS in the results. 


That was pretty much it. Of course, I did some more stuff, but those 4 steps were the core of my onpage strategy. 



## Then, 4 months later: ⚡SHAZAM!⚡

The article went from **289 pageviews** in October to **1603 in January**. 
Those optimizations really helped increase our pageviews +500% and with **ZERO BACKLINKS**.

Also, it went from #9 to #3 for "lente de contato dental" and increased keywords from **108 to 158**. What was just a hunch came out to be true, as you can see for the search volumes, as well. 

So, don't overlook the basics, future me (and friends). When the foundation of an SEO strategy goes well, everything grows. Open your eyes to people's perspective and watch searches trends. 

When it comes to SEO and Growth, it goes beyond technicalities. We need to pay attention to the tides of the users' behaviors, which means, essentially, watch people and their needs.
