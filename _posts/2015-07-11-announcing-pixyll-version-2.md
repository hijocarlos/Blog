Google Search Operators are part of this huge environment of web tools available to us. They are used for a multitude of things on Google, from **SEO** to **prospecting** - and that's why they are so unique.
  

The central role of search operators is to narrow down the result set. Using them, you will be able to find more refined results on SERPS, which allows you to go straight to the point faster. Usually, they are formatted using symbols (like '+', or '-'), words, or combinations of both. You can also use more than one operator/command on a search (that will enrich your results a lot).

I gathered a few (I think there's more) commands and operators to facilitate my job remembering them and decided to share here. So, let's dive in: 

## Advanced Google Search Operators ü¶Ö 

### Allintext:keywords
This operator will return with results that have all your keywords in their <body> tag 

Example: _allintext: best web tips_

### Allintitle:keywords
This operator will return all results with the terms you choose in their title tags. 

Example: _allintitle: organic growth strategies_ (the results will have "organic," "growth" and "strategies" in the title) 

### Allinurl:keywords
The same as in allintitle: it will display all results with the keywords in the URL 

Example: _allinurl:google search operators_

### Cache:
You can use this command when you want to find the latest cache of a specified page.

Example: _cache:website.org_


### Intext:keyword
You can use this operator to find the pages that contain the keyword in the text inside the <body> tag 

Example: _intext:python tutorial_

### Intitle:keyword
It shows results of the keyword you want in the <title> tag.

Example: _easy recipe intitle:chocolate_ (it will return all 'easy recipe' results with 'chocolate' in their titles) 

### Inurl:keyword
Not very difficult to guess, right? It displays pages with the specific keyword on the URL. 

Example: _site:wikipedia.com inurl:Brazil_ (return all pages in Wikipedia with 'Brazil' in the URL) 

### Site:loreipsum.com + keyword
This is one of the most used operators. We can use it to query pages of a specific domain. Without the keyword, you can check all pages indexed by Google. 

With a keyword, Google will return all pages from that site with that keyword. 

Example: _site:thinkgeek.com_ (all pages indexed by Google)

_site:thinkgeek.com nerf guns_ (all pages with the keyword "nerf guns") 



## Advanced Google Search Commands ü¶â

### AND
Using this command, Google search result will show pages that meet all the search queries criteria. 

Example: _site:linkedin.com AND intitle:seo AND intext:link building,_

### OR
The OR command is used to find the search results that meet one of the search query criteria defined. 

Example:_allintext:"hitchhikers guide" OR allinurl:scifi books._ (the results will either have 'hitchhikers guide' in the body text or scifi and book in the URL)


### -keyword (minus)
Using a minus (-) Google will filter and exclude all the results that have that keyword or page.

Example: _best keyword tool -semrush.com_

### +keyword (plus)
You can use a plus (+) to add keywords that you want to be in the search results.

Example:_growth + SEO_

### *
You can use an asterisk (*) instead of any unknown or ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù term. 

Example: _‚Äúsenior digital *‚Äù_

### Related:website.com
You can use this command when you want to find the websites related to another page. 

Example: _related:website.com_

### "Search term here"
When using quotation marks with a search term, Google will return the results with that exact phrase. Very useful when searching for names, products, etc.

Example:  "_The Universe in a Nutshell"_



## Time to mix them up üçπ

Using more than one command or operator you can have more detailed research, and the results will be more on the track of what you want. Few things you can do mixing operators and commands are: 

- Find repeated content on a domain

Let's say your are performing an SEO audit for a client and you want to know how many pages it has on Google with the keyword "audit tools". This is one strategy to avoid keyword cannibalization and repeated contet. You can simply type on Google: 

{% highlight google %}
site:loremipsum.com AND allintitile:audit tools
{% endhighlight  %}

You can also use other operators such as "intext:audit tools" or "allinurl:audit tools", that's up to you! 

- Find contacs on LinkedIn using peripheral information 

By peripheral, I mean non-direct information. For example, you'd like to find people who work in Marketing at Google in LinkedIn's public domain (/in). You could go for: 

{% highlight google %}
"* marketing * at google" inurl:linkedin.com/in site:linkedin.com
{% endhighlight  %}

- Find opportunities for guest posting for link building  

If you are looking for news oppotunities to create content for others and build a link building strategy from there, you can try this queries on Google:   

{% highlight google %}
 [your key phrase] blogs inurl:guest-post
 {% endhighlight  %}
 
Then you can start prospecting better :) 

## Conclusion ü§û
As you can see, Google not only is the best search engine machine in the whole wide world web, but is also an information plataform on its own, and it allows you to navigate better between its search results. 

Commands and operators are time saving, practical and a very good way to find more relevant results. So, next time you go to the big G, remember those 'cause they can save you a lifetime! 

See ya!
